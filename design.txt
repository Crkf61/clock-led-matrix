SOFTWARE
    CORE_TIME
        get current time with datetime
        use class for time string methods and RTC methods
        decide if you need to update the clock +
        make the time string from current date and time

    LED_MATRIX
        print text to led matrix
    
    CHANGING_TIME
        check if button is pressed
        check if new text needs displaying and format as before
        read plus and minus pins and increase or decrease the selected time
        read select pin and read finish pin
        update selected time accordingly
    
    CHANGING_BRIGHTNESS
        read LDR analog input
        read potentiometer input
        apply logic to find brightness to send to LED matrix
