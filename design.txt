SOFTWARE
    CORE_TIME
        get current time with datetime
        use class for time string methods and RTC methods
        decide if you need to update the clock +
        make the time string from current date and time
        -- class 'RTCTimeString' handles RTC and formatting into string
        
    LED_MATRIX
        print text to led matrix
        -- class 'MatrixPrinter' takes in string of length 5 and prints to LED matrix
          -> want to make it so that it only updates necessary characters.
          -> currently, the text flashes whenever it is updated, which is annoying.
          -> Flashing fixed! simple bug, I was calling mx.begin at the start of
               each loop. needed to make  mxprinter class definition global not in loop()
    
    CHANGING_TIME
        check if button is pressed
        check if new text needs displaying and format as before
        read plus and minus pins and increase or decrease the selected time
        read select pin and read finish pin
        update selected time accordingly
        -> implemented! just in main function as this was much easier than a seperate class-
             the changing time functions need access to the timestring and printing functions
    
    CHANGING_BRIGHTNESS
        read LDR analog input
        read potentiometer input
        apply logic to find brightness to send to LED matrix
        -> didn't do this as i was running out of time.
        -> instead, change brightness with + and - buttons when not changing the time
